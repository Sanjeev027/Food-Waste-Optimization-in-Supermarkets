# 🥫 Food Waste Optimization in Supermarkets (Power BI Dashboard)

This Power BI project analyzes and visualizes food waste data across supermarket chains to help identify inefficiencies, reduce operational losses, and promote sustainability in food retail.

## 📊 Project Summary

Food waste is a major issue in large retail environments due to overstocking, spoilage, expiration, and poor demand forecasting. This dashboard helps stakeholders monitor key metrics, investigate patterns of waste, and make data-driven decisions.
